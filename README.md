# Motivation

- I need a place to store my blogs, without depending on any blog publisher.
- I write on my own tool, on my own language, then publish it to the blog publisher when I want.
- Therefore, I think Markdown + Git will be a good choice.

Benefits:
- Offline mode.
- History is saved everyday in my local and on the cloud by git IF I setup a bot to commit and push the code everyday.
- I can clone it to blog on other machine whenever I want.
- I can use .gitignore to publish only public information.

# Tools
Atom: I use Atom to write because it is lightweight, can render Markdown and other language. As well as simplify opening project and files.
Markdown: I use Markdown because this is a popular markup language on the web, so I can convert from Markdown to HTML pretty easy.
Git: I use git to store history. I can search by time, as well as content.

# Manually commit

Because I haven't had a bot yet, so I will write a script to commit it manually.
