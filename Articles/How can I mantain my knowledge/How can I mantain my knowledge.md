# Motivation

- There is a lots knowledge I used to learn but I forgot about that.
- There is a lots knowledge I want to share later but I forgot about that.

# Solution

- I start write what I learnt and share that with audience.
- I put all blogs in one place, where I can store its history and I can search it in the future.
- I have a Trello board to maintain my work, to free up my memory.
